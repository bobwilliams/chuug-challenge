# Problem

Your program should take a path to a file as  command line argument. The path will be a flat file of URLs separated by carriage return. The URLs will point to a page of text. Your program should output a text file containing the aggregate word counts for all the URLs contained in the flat file. Additionally, your program should also display the time it took from initial invocation to the completion of writing the output file.
